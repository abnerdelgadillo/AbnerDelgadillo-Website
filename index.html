        <p class="lead mb-4">Hello my name is Abner Delgadillo and I am currently a student of the College of Natural & Agriculture Sciences at the University of California Riverside. I am pursuing a bachelorâ€™s degree in the studies of Neuroscience in further hopes to continue my education onto medical school. I am a 27 year old first generation Hispanic. My parents immigrated to the United States in hopes to provide a better future for me and my siblings. My interest in the medical field started when I was child, but my interest in Neuroscience started a few years back. The science of the brain has always interested me because it is fairly new. Not much is known about how the brain works so I took it as a challenge to try and learn as much as possible. I am also interested in learning to code, because I feel that will be greatly needed in the future. Knowing the language of the computer will give an advantage because of the fact that computer knowledge is so important in todayâ€™s society. <br><br>

         I started my education at Rio Hondo College where I received associateâ€™s degree in Chemistry, Biology, and General Studies with an emphasis in math and science. When I was attending Rio Hondo, I was involved in many programs/clubs such as MESA, STEM, and the Pre-Health Club. The MESA club is a club that stood for Math Engineering Science Achievements and it was a club that emphasized on helping and guiding students who wanted to pursue degrees in those majors. We were able to provide workshops, resources, research opportunities and much more. While I was in MESA, I was able to further my education by taking a research opportunity at the University of California Irvine. The researched pertained to working with robotic surgical machines, and it was a very great learning experience<br><br>

        At the University of California Riverside, I am part of three clubs. Here at the University I am part of the LMSA+, Neuroscience club, and the local chapter of AMSA. Outside of school, I have 8 years of experience in the health care system. Iâ€™m currently employed at the Las Americas Medical Clinic, which is a clinic serving the underserved community Arleta in the San Fernando Valley. There at the clinic we focus on outreaching and teaching people about the health care system and the precautions one should take to remain as healthy as possible. At the clinic I was responsible for the funding and planning of the local health fairs. The local health fairs were organized once a year so that we were able to provide free healthcare to people I need. I have also done volunteer work at the Downey Presbyterian hospital for over 3 years, and I found it to be a very good learning experience.
